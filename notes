  swords, shields, and gold are placed by medicines (white cells, chemo packs, steroids, etc)
  Should help kids understand body and illness

  Gameplay
    6x6 tile grid with 5 tile varieties? Or Snake and bake sized layout?
    player matches adjacent tiles in a single line by tracing with finger
    each time the player matches, cancer cells divide
    player must eliminate all cancer cells to win


Each time player moves malignant cells multiply to adjacent cells
the multiplying cell leaves behind benign cells
if it multiplies to a non white cell, it multiplies malignant
if it multiplies to a white cell, it multiplies benign
the goal of each level is to remove all malignant cells
you lose if the board ever contains only red cells and bad cells
there could be 3 varieties of bad cells that are resistant to different types of treatment
in order to stop multiplication, player need to use medicine to strengthen cells near bad cells
there is a specific medicine for each color of bad cell
each higher medicine requires more of it to treat a single cell
  blue: 1, purple 2, green 3
